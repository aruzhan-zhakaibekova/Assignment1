        <p> We live, we work, we create, and we love in cities. We also live to create the cities that we love. New York and Abu Dhabi - two vibrant hubs for trade, connection, and creativity. This documentary film aims to draw incredible parallels between these two nodes on a world map. </p>
        <p> The film explores the themes of urban life, youth, creativity, and human connection. Immersing the audience into the cityscapes, sounds, and colors of the cities, New Dhabi/Abu York is a kaleidoscope of memories and stories. Despite distance, humans enjoy music, laugh, and show kindness in the same way. Perhaps we are heading towards a new future of global cities, where New Dhabi and Abu York are a possibility. </p>
        <p> Premiered at the 30 Minute Film Festival in Cannes in 2022, the film is scheduled to release to a wider audience on February 17, 2022. </p>
